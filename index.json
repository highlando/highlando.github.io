For nonlinear PDEs, this is readily applied to low-dimensional linear parameter- varying (LPV) approximations as they have been exploited for efficient nonlinear controller design via series expansions of the solution to the state-dependent Riccati equation. In this work, we develop a polytopic autoencoder for control applications and show how it outperforms standard linear approaches in view of LPV approximations of nonlinear systems and how the particular architecture enables higher order series expansions at little extra computational effort. We illustrate the properties and potentials of this approach to computational nonlinear controller design for large-scale systems with a thorough numerical study.","tags":[],"title":"Deep Polytopic Autoencoders for Low-dimensional Linear Parameter-varying Approximations and Nonlinear Feedback Design","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Heiland","Yongho Kim"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1706001335,"objectID":"442b67a40785860fb2d7a7b43a5c8303","permalink":"/publication/hei-k-24/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hei-k-24/","section":"publication","summary":"With the advancement of neural networks, there has been a notable increase, both in terms of quantity and variety, in research publications concerning the application of autoencoders to reduced-order models. We propose a polytopic autoencoder architecture that includes a lightweight nonlinear encoder, a convex combination decoder, and a smooth clustering network. Supported by several proofs, the model architecture ensures that all reconstructed states lie within a polytope, accompanied by a metric indicating the quality of the constructed polytopes, referred to as polytope error. Additionally, it offers a minimal number of convex coordinates for polytopic linear-parameter varying systems while achieving acceptable reconstruction errors compared to proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). To validate our proposed model, we conduct simulations involving two flow scenarios with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. Numerical results demonstrate the guaranteed properties of the model, low reconstruction errors compared to POD, and the improvement in error using a clustering network.","tags":[],"title":"Polytopic Autoencoders with Smooth Clustering for Reduced-order Modelling of Flows","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Timm Faulwasser","Ion Victor Gosea","Jan Heiland","Matthias Voigt","Karl Worthmann","Enrique Zuazua"],"categories":null,"content":"Table of Contents  Advanced Topics in Systems and Control Schedule  Nov 20\u0026ndash;24 \u0026ndash; Introductory Research Talks Nov 27\u0026ndash;Dec 01 \u0026ndash; Learning, Control and Systems Dec 04\u0026ndash;08 \u0026ndash; (e)DMD and port-Hamiltonian Systems Dec 11\u0026ndash;15 \u0026ndash; System Identification, Model Reduction, Data-driven MPC Dec 18\u0026ndash;22 \u0026ndash; Numerical Methods in Linear Control Theory Dec 25\u0026ndash;Dec 29 \u0026ndash; Robust and Nonlinear Control with Linear Methods   Speaker Information    Advanced Topics in Systems and Control    Location online, hosted by Jiangsu University of Science and Technology     Dates November/December 2023   Times 08:00\u0026ndash;12:00 / 15:00\u0026ndash;19:00 (Berlin / Beijing time)   Organizer Jan Heiland (MPI Magdeburg, Germany), Pengfei Zhi (JSUST, Jiang Su, China)   Audience Open for everyone, designed for Master Students of Automation and Electrical Engineering   Speaker Jan Heiland, Timm Faulwasser, Ion Victor Gosea, Matthias Voigt, Karl Worthmann, Enrique Zuazua    Sounds interesting?

While linear algebra packages and algorithms for solving, say, Riccati equations can handle the large system sizes, the theory for Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems has been successfully employed for nonlinear controller design. Within this project, we want to make the LPV theory accessible for numerical controller design for nonlinear large-scale systems.\nThe core idea is to use approximations to provide low-dimensional LPV surrogate models for nonlinear input-affine systems which then will be the base for designing the controller by established LPV theory.\nRepresentations of nonlinear systems as LPV systems have been used before for nonlinear controller design. A new direction that we will explore here will be the inclusion of model order reduction techniques to primarily reduce the parameter dimension in order to make the controller design numerically feasible also for systems of large state space dimension.\nIf model reduction is involved, the surrogate model for the controller design is no more exact which may lead to failures of the controller. Within this project, we want to establish to what extend such model errors can be compensated by robustness margins of the controllers. For plain linear time-invariant systems, the standard H-infinity theory provides general relevant results. A generalization of these results to cover parameter reductions in LPV systems is another objective of this project.\nFor the realization in numerical simulations, nonlinear model reduction approaches are the method of choice as they have proven to outperform linear approaches like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) at very low dimensions. This project aims at gaining practical insights in using these comparatively recent approaches for reducing the parameter dimension in LPV models to be employed for controller design for nonlinear large-scale systems like spatially discretized Navier-Stokes equations.\nRelated Publications  Low-Complexity Linear Parameter-Varying Approximations of Incompressible Navier-Stokes Equations for Truncated State-Dependent Riccati Feedback Jan Heiland, Steffen W.

In view of robust control, we will in particular focus on estimates that also include system uncertainties and model reduction errors.\nFinally, we will bring together the computation of the controller gains and the norm estimates to robustly stabilize incompressible flows in two different setups of the well-known cylinder wake.\n  Benner, P.; Heiland, J. \u0026amp; Werner, S.

As long as the system is linear, the computational demands (1.) are well met by powerful and modern linear algebra tools and specialized hardware. A nonlinearity (2.) in small dimensions can be treated through system insights or, sometimes, by repeated linearizations. If nonlinear and large-scale comes together things become tricky.\nHere, we try to find the way out by proposing a formulation that is\n linear by its overall structure with the nonlinearities parametrized by just a few number of parameters.  System approximation by low-dimensional linear parametrizations In the (nonlinear) Navier-Stokes equations that describe the evolution of fluid flow, the nonlinear term is given by the convection term in the form $$ f(v) = N(v), v $$ where, for any velocity field $v$, the convection operator $N(v)$ describes how the velocity field itself is convected. In a simulation $N(v)$ is a matrix that multiplies the state vector $v$. Despite this matrix structure, the nonlinearity $N(v),v$ is deemed complex because $v$ and $N(v)$ are typically very large. If, however, one could approximately (but sufficiently accurately) parametrize $N(v)$ by, say, three scalar parameters $(\\rho_1(v), \\rho_2(v), \\rho_3(v))$ and three basis matrices $N_1$, $N_2$, and $N_3$, i.e. $$ N(v) \\approx \\rho_1(v)N_1 + \\rho_2(v)N_2 + \\rho_3(v)N_3x $$ then the nonlinearity $$ N(v),v \\approx \\rho_1(v)N_1,v + \\rho_2(v)N_2,v + \\rho_3(v)N_3,v $$ becomes replaced by a hopefully easy computation of $\\rho(v)$ and, notably, just three matrix vector multiplications \u0026ndash; the standard operation of numerical linear algebra. And the problem, as we wanted it, appears to be basically linear and only with a low dimensional nonlinearity.\nLow-dimensional parametrization of fluid flow In view of parametrizing $N(v)$, we look for a low-dimensional approximative parametrization of $v$. Low-dimensional approximations of the state of dynamical systems is both the core and promise of classical model order reduction. For our application, however, we would like to trade in some accuracy for very low dimensionality for what classical model reduction techniques are notoriously unsuited.\n Snapshot of a developed flow behind a cylinder.  Therefore, we explored how deep convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) could be of help here. CAEs have been developed and successfully used two encode images in a low-dimensional latent feature space for, e.g., classification purposes. For us, the images will be velocity states (as we would plot them, e.g., in Figure 1) and the space of latent features will provide us with a low dimensional parametrization (see Figure 2/3 of an example architecture and an illustration of the dimension reduction).\nApart from providing a flexible and thanks to modern machine learning toolboxes efficiently implementable encoding and decoding mechanism, deep convolutional autoencoders seems a good choice for our tasks as\n by the socalled sparse connectivity the neural network itself requires a moderate number of parameters despite possibly large dimensions of the data the implemented operations are shift invariant, meaning a pattern will be detected equally well independent of its position (which seems a good thing to have when thinking of fluid flow) the reduction operation of pooling can be seen as providing a multilevel view on the data   A schematic illustration of a convolutional autoencoder.  Simulation of low-dimensionally parametrized flows We considered the two dimensional flow behind a round obstacle that develops a periodic shedding of vertices (see Figure 1). In our simulations, we checked if we can indeed replace the $50'000$ dimensional $v$ in $N(v)$ by $\\rho(v)$ with literally only $3$ components.\n An illustrative sketch of how the velocity field data is processed by the convolutional neural network to provide the low dimensional code $\\rho$.  Since in these systems, from a local perspective, small changes can have extreme impacts, differences in the simulation are best evaluated qualitively. Therefore, instead of plotting errors between trajectories (as we did for drag and lift in Figure 4 anyways), we sketched out the phase portrait of how drag and lift that the cylinder experiences evolve in the 2D plane over time.\n Trajectories of drag and lift over time for the full order model and the low-order parametrized models by the convolutional neural network (CNN) and by POD of dimension $3$.   The phase portraits corresponding to the trajectories of drag and lift as displayed in Figure 5.  From Figure 5 we can observe that the CAE approach with 3 parameters well approximates the limit cycle of the full order simulation both in position in size (in particular if compared to the rather standard parametrization approach using POD).\nBibliography For further reading we recommend our paper  Jan Heiland, Peter Benner, Rezvan Bahmani  (2022).

In short,\n  MR Fingerprinting relies on the simulation of the Bloch equation, a parameter-dependent ODE for the magnetization $M$ of the form $$\\dot{M}(t) = f(M(t), B(t), T_1, T_2),$$ where the magnetic field $B$ is determined by the parameters of the acquisition.\n  Variation of the relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$ yield a series of trajectories forming a so-called dictionary.\n  Fingerprinting means the matching of the acquired under-sampled data with the dictionary entries for querying the relevant tissue-specific parameters.\n  The development and implementation opens a number of options for a Master\u0026rsquo;s project:\n  System Theory: Re-formulation of the MRF dictionary computation as an input-state-output system and model order reduction of the underlying Bloch equation. While the reformulation enables the matching by established system identification routines, a reduced order model can be used for a-posteriori checks of the selected parameters or for enriching the dictionary in the relevant parameter range.\n  Statistics: The estimation of parameters based on data is a common task in statistics. Apart from implementing and testing relevant routines for Fingerprinting, the inclusion of tailored statistical approaches for the particular problem of Fingerprinting can be useful for improving the dictionary in general and for providing confidence estimates for the selection obtained from classical matching.\n  Optimization: Fingerprinting seeks for the best match of collected data with the precomputed dictionary entries.

Recently Galerkin methods based on Krylov subspaces were developed for the autonomous differential Riccati equation. These methods overcome the prohibitively large storage requirements and computational costs of the numerical solution. In view of memory efficient approximation, we review and extend known solution formulas and identify invariant subspaces for a possibly low-dimensional solution representation. Based on these theoretical findings, we propose a Galerkin projection onto a space related to a low-rank approximation of the algebraic Riccati equation. For the numerical implementation, we provide an alternative interpretation of the modified emphDavison-Maki method via the transformed flow of the differential Riccati equation, which enables us to rule out known stability issues of the method in combination with the proposed projection scheme. We present numerical experiments for large-scale autonomous differential Riccati equations and compare our approach with high-order splitting schemes.","tags":[],"title":"Invariant Galerkin Ansatz Spaces and Davison-Maki Methods for the Numerical Solution of Differential Riccati Equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Heiland"],"categories":null,"content":"Abstract The stabilization of a simple pendulum in the upright equilibrium is a common control task and can be realized with basic algorithms and basic hardware like Lego Mindstorm.

Still, linear feedback controllers that counteract perturbations in real time are capable to stabilize equilibria of a double pendulum as well as trajectories. For the control of a triple pendulum, the same linear theory applies. The third segment, however, adds additional technical difficulties that need to be tackled with powerful hardware.\nIn this talk, I will explain the principles of a linearization based 2-degrees of freedom controller design which is the combination of a feedforward control that prescribes a target trajectory and a feedback loop for stabilization of the system. For the nonlinear mathematical model of a triple pendulum, already the computation of the target trajectory and the feedforward control is a challenge.

The media prominently advertised the strategy stay at home in order to flatten the curve.\nIn this joint talk, we present two mathematical modeling strategies for infectious disease. In the first part, we consider a classical compartment approach which splits the population into different groups, for example Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR model). The evolution of the numbers in each compartment can be described mathematically in form of a system of coupled ordinary differential equations. The transition rates between the different compartments (e.g. infection rate, recovery rate) can be adjusted through available data. For the modeling of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Germany, the SIDHARTE version of a compartment model has been developed1 in order to simulate and predict the spread of the epidemic and to model possible countermeasures.\nIn the second part of the talk, the spreading of the disease on a graph representing a smaller population sample is presented. In this model the graph represents a hospital or other institution in which a COVID-19 outbreak could be harmful. In this model we are particularly interested in finding a suitable test strategy, which is one way to apply control to the system. In general is the question of the right control mechanisms to flatten the curve or slow the spread of virus still an open one.\n  G. Giordano, F. Blanchini, R. Bruno, P. Colaneri, A. Di Filippo, A.

Only recently, we have transferred iterative algorithms that allow the computation of solutions to LQR Riccati equations in the large-scale setting to the indefinite Riccati equations that appear in robust control. For descriptor systems, the relevant Riccati equations are nonsymmetric and, for large-scale systems, there is no established algorithm that can handle these even in the LQR case.\nIn this paper, we show how the general theory for descriptor systems with index-1 pencil coincides with the theory for standard linear time invariant case with feedthrough terms. This provides an algorithm to characterize and to compute the solution to the generalized indefinite Riccati equations via standard Riccati equations. In view of feasibility for large-scale descriptor systems, we illustrate how to arrive at the equivalent standard Riccati-equation without resorting to the canonical form used in the derivation of the theoretical results.\n","date":1589371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589371200,"objectID":"fc0de5a5ac811caed8333cdbe5529c23","permalink":"/event/20-ecc-hinfric/","publishdate":"2020-04-11T16:01:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/event/20-ecc-hinfric/","section":"event","summary":"The equivalence of Riccati approaches for index-1 descriptor systems and standard LTI systems with feedthrough.","tags":["BenH20"],"title":"Equivalence of Riccati-Based Robust Controller Design for Index-1 Descriptor Systems and Standard Plants with Feedthrough","type":"event"},{"authors":["Jan Heiland"],"categories":null,"content":"Turnpike and Linear Systems Theory Old Formulas and New Results It is often observed, that the solution to an optimal control problem on a finite but large time horizon stays close to an associated steady state optimal solution most of the time. This phenomenon is called turnpike property. It has been addressed in the research of economics since the 60s and has become a popular topic in systems and control in the last 20 years.\nThe turnpike property is intimately related to the exponential decay of the solution to a differential Riccati equation towards the stabilizing solution of the associated algebraic Riccati equation (ARE).\nIn this talk, I will show how the basic result on turnpike (namely that the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem enjoys the turnpike property) follows from classical system theory results by Callier, Willems, and Winkin1. With these results, we can also directly address borderline cases like that of undetectable systems. By means of an explicit formula for the state transition matrix of the forward and backward closed loop system, we extend the classical results to the affine case, i.e., the case with nonzero control targets.\nIn the second part of the talk, we discuss the turnpike property of LQR problems with DAE constraints. Under standard assumptions, we establish existence of solutions to the generalized (nonsymmetric) differential Riccati equation and conditions for their convergence to a solution of the generalized ARE. With these results, we can characterize the turnpike property for DAE control problems.\n  Callier, F. M.; Winkin, J. \u0026amp; Willems, J. L.

In this analysis, we take the data and extract the numbers that describe how the growth of casualties develops. Looking at the trends in these numbers, one may deduce how fast or how slow the virus is spreading and also compare how the situation evolves in different countries.\nFeel free to use the python implementation that produces the presented plots and that can be modified to show the results for any country that is in the JHU data base.\nThis post bases on joint efforts and discussions of the CSC group at the MPI Magdeburg.\nThe numbers in the presented plots are updated automatically1.\nTable of Contents  Summary Why This Analysis The Analysis  Illustrative Examples General Explanations of the Numbers What It Would Look Like and What It Should Look Like   The Actual Numbers  The last 100 days The last 30 days   Notes and Acknowledgements        Why This Analysis If one looks at the actual numbers generated by an exponential growth, the overall growth is so strong, that one barely sees changes in the dynamics. If one looks at the numbers in log scale, the data becomes more handy. In log scale an exponential growth looks like a straight line and the slope of the line indicates how fast the exponential growth is.\nTo see whether the exponential growth changes its dynamics, one may check whether the line in the logarithmic plot changes its slope (hopefully it gets less steep). That\u0026rsquo;s why we plot the slope of the logarithmic line that connects the numbers of two consecutive days. Since the data is wiggly, we also plot averages of the slopes over 2 or 5 days to better spot the trends.\nThis post was inspired by an illustration that was discussed on twitter2 in the last days:   Lockdowns and the numbers of deaths in Italy and Hubei  It shows how, seemingly, the exponential growth in casualties did decrease some days after lockdowns have been implemented. In this analysis, we try to automatically detect such changes in the growth for a number of countries and represent it in an accessible form that allows easy comparisons.\nThe Analysis We examine the (logarithmic) slope of the curves of the accumulated cases per day. That is for day d and the day d-1 before that day, we look at log2(x[d]) - log2(x[d-1]), where x holds the number of accumulated deaths for every day and where log2 is a function that computes the logarithm of a number with respect to the basis3 2.\nThe resulting slope is exactly the daily increase in the number of cases in relation to the overall number of cases. As this is easier to interprete, we translate the slopes into the daily increase in percent.\nIllustrative Examples To make sense of the numbers, we start with some example scenarios. In the plot below, we have plotted the values for some fictitious growth scenarios.\n  An exponential growth \u0026ndash; every day d the number of additional cases is 1.1**d (speak: 1.1 to the power of d and think of a daily increase by 10%). This scenario leads to a constant value in the plots of around 0.14.\n  A constant growth \u0026ndash; every day another 10 cases are added. This is like the number of daily deaths due to traffic incidents in Germany4 in 2010.\n  A growth that decreases exponentially \u0026ndash; every day the number of additional cases gets smaller exponentially.\n    The daily increase of the accumulated cases for the example scenarios  General Explanations of the Numbers  A constant value means that the number of deaths grows exponentially.  If this constant is 10[%], this means that the numbers of cases doubles every week. A value of about 7[%], means a doubling every 10 days.   A decreasing curve indicates that the exponential growth of infected people is stalled or reversed. If the value approaches 0, this indicates that the virus is contained.  What It Would Look Like and What It Should Look Like To have a comparison of what an uncontrolled spread and what a well controlled spread would look like, we ran two simulations in a covid simulator5.\n A scenario for Germany in which no interventions are taken. A scenario for which we defined interventions such that the number of hospitalized patients that require intensive care (ICU) was always below 45000.    The daily increase of the accumulated casualties and the numbers of people in need for intensive care due to an infection by COVID-19 for the simulated scenarios. The kink in the red curve is due to the stop of some interventions after 205 days.  In the uncontrolled case, exponential growth is detected with a rate of 15[%] of daily increase. After some time, when most people have been infected the, growth decreases down to zero.\nIn the controlled scenario, the rate is brought down in the initial phase. Then, exponential growth happens at a lower rate (in the plot the value is about 5[%]) though for a longer time before it fades out.\nTo relate the slopes to the actual cases, in a second plot, we display the corresponding numbers of people that will need intensive care in a hospital. In our model, we assumed that 1.15% of the infected people will have to be treated in an intensive care unit.\nThe Actual Numbers We use the JHU for the last 100 days and plot the slopes for the last 90 days. The moving horizon of 100 days makes the changes of the last 3 months better visible. By plotting only 90 days, we omit a part of the wiggly behavior in the start of the data (which however is not relevant for the main part).\nThe last 100 days See the pdf file for more countries and a better resolution of the plots.\n  The daily increase of the accumulated cases (of the last 100 days) for a number of countries. The colored background marks the days where the number of deaths was below 100, 300, 900, 2700, 8100, 24300, \u0026hellip;, respectively. The total number is the number of deaths in the last 100 days. The first 6 countries are always shown. The other 2 countries change occasionally. See the pdf for all countries.   The plots are updated every day.   ## Other Things that can be Seen * The curves seem to have similar phases. A phase of exponential growth followed by a decrease. * The curves differ in the length of the phases (France seems to have a long phase of exponential growth if compared to Spain) * And the starting points are different which gives a hint on when the outbreak became visible in the different countries. -- The last 30 days Since we look at the relative growth, so called saturation effects will make changes less visible. This happens in particular, with a high number of cases but a low number of active cases. In the long run, exponential growth will still be visible, but also the short term dynamics are of interest. For example, to spot the start of a second wave.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why the following plots consider the daily numbers for the last 40 days (leaving aside all cases that happened before) and show the daily increase of the number cases in percent for the last 30 days.\n  The daily change accumulated cases (in percent, counting from 40 days ago) for a number of countries and the total numbers of cases for the last month. The first 5 countries are always shown. The other 3 countries change occasionally. See the pdf for all countries.

Also, we factorize the mass matrix mmat for later use and define the norm that is weighted with the mass matrix as this is the discrete $L^2$ norm.\n# ## the mass matrix mform = dolfin.inner(v, u)*dolfin.dx massm = dolfin.assemble(mform) mmat = dolfin.as_backend_type(massm).sparray() mmat.eliminate_zeros() # factorize it for later mfac = SparseFactorMassmat(mmat) # norm induced by the mass matrix == discrete L2-norm def mnorm(uvec): return np.sqrt(np.inner(uvec, mmat.dot(uvec))) # ## the stiffness matrix # as a form in FEniCS aform = nu*dolfin.inner(dolfin.grad(v), dolfin.grad(u))*dolfin.dx aassm = dolfin.assemble(aform) # as a sparse matrix amat = dolfin.as_backend_type(aassm).sparray() amat.eliminate_zeros()  Then we define the convective term as function of the velocity u both in terms of an FE-function and as a function of the associated coefficient vector.\n# ## the convective term # as a function in FEniCS def burgers_nonl_func(ufun): cform = dolfin.inner(dolfin.grad(ufun)*ufun, v)*dolfin.dx cass = dolfin.assemble(cform) return cass # as a vector to form map def burgers_nonl_vec(uvec): ufun = dolfin.Function(V) ufun.vector().set_local(uvec) bnlform = burgers_nonl_func(ufun) bnlvec = bnlform.get_local() return bnlvec  The Runge-Kutta Time Integration To apply standard time integration schemes (here, RK23 turned out to be most efficient), we define the right hand side $f_h$ of the spatially discretized problem\n$$ \\dot u_h = f_h (t_h, u_h). $$\nIn this case the right hand side is an application of the discrete diffusion and convection operator and the inverse of the mass matrix that, simply speaking, maps a (discrete) form onto a discrete function. Note that there is no explicit time dependency in the Burgers equation, but the SciPy\u0026rsquo;s solve_ivp requires this parameter. Also, we define the initial value here. The time grid is used to store the solution for the snapshots needed later, but the time integrator uses his internal time grid.\ninivstrg = 'exp(-3.*(x[0]*x[0]+x[1]*x[1]))' inivexpr = dolfin.Expression((inivstrg, inivstrg), degree=2) inivfunc = dolfin.interpolate(inivexpr, V) inivvec = inivfunc.vector().get_local() burgsol = solve_ivp(brhs, (t0, tE), inivvec, t_eval=timegrid, method='RK23') fullsol = burgsol.y  Here is the result. Note the sharp front that develops towards the end of the time integration.\n  Solution snapshots of the full FEM model  2. POD Reduced Model If one has snapshots of the solution $v _ h$ at some time instances $t _ i$ one may well think that the span of the matrix of snapshots\n$$ X = \\begin{bmatrix} v _ h(t_0) \u0026amp; v _ h(t_1) \u0026amp; \\dotsm \u0026amp; v _ h(t_k) \\end{bmatrix} $$\nis a good candidate for a space in which the solution evolves in. One may even go further and look for a low-dimensional basis of this space. The span of a matrix is best approximated by its dominant singular vectors. And this is the idea of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) \u0026ndash; use the leading singular vectors as a basis for the solution space.\nWe use the Nts=101 snapshots of the FEM solutions to setup the matrix of measurements $X$ and to compute the POD modes as $M^{-1/2}v _ k$, where $v _ k$ is the $k$-th leading left singular vector of $M^{1/2}X$. This procedure gives a low-dimensional orthogonal (in the discrete $L^2$ inner product) basis that optimally parametrizes the subspace of $L^2$ that is spanned by the solution snapshots1. In this example, we use the poddim=30 leading singular vectors to define the reduced model.\nsnapshotmat = mfac.Ft.dot(burgsol.y) podmodes, svals, _ = spla.svd(snapshotmat, full_matrices=False) selected_podmodes = podmodes[:, :poddim] podvecs = mfac.solve_Ft(selected_podmodes)  In this implementation we use a sparse factor of the mass matrix instead of the square root. The singular values (in particular those that correspond to the discarded directions) give an indication of how good the approximation is.\n  The singular values of the snapshot matrix  Here, the decay is comparatively slow, so that a one should not expect a good low dimensional approximation by POD.\nFor the simulation, the state is parametrized by $u_h (t) \\approx V \\tilde u_h(t)$ where $V$ is the matrix of the POD modes (in the code $V$ denoted by podvecs), which gives a system in $\\tilde u _ h$ with 30 degrees of freedom (as opposed to the 51842 of the full order model).\nredamat = podvecs.T.dot(amat.dot(podvecs)) # the projected stiffness def redbrhs(time, redvec): inflatedv = podvecs.dot(redvec) redconv = podvecs.T.dot(burgers_nonl_vec(inflatedv)) return -redamat.dot(redvec) - redconv.flatten()  Here we define the projected stiffness matrix and the reduced nonlinearity through\n inflating the reduced state to full dimension applying the nonlinearity projecting down the result.  This means that our model is not completely independent of the full dimension. For this problem there are hyperreduction techniques like DEIM.\nThus, the right hand side is readily defined the more that the projected mass matrix is the identity. Why?\nFinally, the initial value is projected into the reduced coordinates and the reduced system is integrated in time.\nredburgsol = solve_ivp(redbrhs, (t0, tE), prjinivvec, t_eval=timegrid, method='RK23') podredsol = redburgsol.y  In the solution we see that the reduced order model gives a decent approximation in the smooth regime in the beginning and even well approaches the front as can be seen in the error (log) plot.\n   Snapshots of the solution of the reduced system    Snapshots of the log of the error between the full and the POD solution \n3. DMD Reduced Model POD is partially data driven \u0026ndash; it uses data to create a basis but still uses (a projection of) the model. If only snapshots but no model is given, one may use the method of Dynamic Mode Decomposition2 (DMD) that tries to identify a matrix $A$ that evolves the state like\n$$ A v _ h (t_i) = v _ h (t _ {i+1}) $$\nIn practice, one uses a set of snapshots and the two measurement matrices\n$$ X = \\begin{bmatrix} v _ h(t_0) \u0026amp; v _ h(t_1) \u0026amp; \\dotsm \u0026amp; v _ h(t _ {k-1}) \\end{bmatrix} $$ and $$ X' = \\begin{bmatrix} v _ h(t_1) \u0026amp; v _ h(t_2) \u0026amp; \\dotsm \u0026amp; v _ h(t _ {k}) \\end{bmatrix}. $$\nNote that $X'$ is basically $X$ shifted by one time step.\nThen the DMD matrix can be found by solving the linear regression problem\n$$ \\min _ P | X' - PX | _ F. $$\nFor the reduced DMD model we use the same snapshot matrix as for the POD. The regression problem is solved via SVD to compute the needed pseudo inverse since this naturally allows for a rank reduction and a factored representation of the DMD matrix.\n# ### dmd using truncated svd inverse fburgsol = burgsol.y Xmat = fburgsol[:, :-1] Xdsh = fburgsol[:, 1:] ux, sx, vxh = spla.svd(Xmat, full_matrices=False) uxr, sxr, vxhr = ux[:, :poddim], sx[:poddim], vxh[:poddim, :] # compute the dmd matrix in factored form: `dmda = dmdaone * dmdatwo` dmdaone = Xdsh.dot(vxhr.T) dmdatwo = np.linalg.solve(np.diag(sxr), uxr.T)  Once the DMD matrix $A$ is determined, the simulation of the DMD reduced model is only a repeated multiplication by $A$.\n# simulation of the dmd reduced model dmdxo = inivvec dmdsol = [dmdxo] for k in np.arange(Nts): dmdsol.append(dmdaone.dot(dmdatwo.dot(dmdsol[-1]))) dmdsol = np.array(dmdsol).T  As can be seen from the results and the error plots, DMD does a good job in the initial phase but fails in the region with the sharp front.\n   Snapshots of the DMD solution    Error (log) plot with respect to the full FEM solution \n4. Testing the Models for Different Initial Value In what was presented above, the reduced models were used to reproduce the states that they were trained on. We now check the given reduced order models but on an alternative initial value, namely\n$$ u\\bigr| _ {t=0}(x _ 1, x _ 2) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} e ^ {-(2x _ 1^2 + 4x _ 2^2)} $$\nsee the following two plots of the full order model for both initial values.\n   Solution snapshots of the full FEM model    Solution snapshots of the full FEM model with the alternative initial value \nThen we use the reduced order models to compute predictions for the trajectory starting in this alternative initial value.\n   Snapshots of the solution of the POD reduced system starting in the alternative initial value.    Snapshots of the DMD solution starting in the alternative initial value. \nBoth methods completely fail to produce the other trajectory. For the POD reduced model already the starting point is extremely bad approximated. Interestingly, although the DMD solution starts in the right point, it seems to exactly reproduce the solution that it was trained on up to some additional oscillations.\n5. Remarks It is commonly accepted that POD does not work well for transport dominated problems \u0026ndash; like the current case with the low viscosity parameter nu=1e-4.\nSo, I think that the results for POD are quite good noting that the reduced order model has 30 degrees of freedom whereas the full model has 51842. In my tests, increasing the number of basis functions as well as considering a larger nu led to better POD approximations.\nThe DMD approach shows a similar performance. If compared to POD, the qualitative approximation looks less good but the numbers are slightly better. All in all, the DMD approximation seems less reliable as for other parameter choices, the performance rather deteriorated than improved.\nHow challenging the problem of 2D Burgers with a low viscosity is, can be seen from the failure of both methods to produce useable approximations to trajectories that start in different initial values.\n  See, e.g., Lemma 2.5 of Baumann, Benner, and Heiland (2018): Space-Time Galerkin POD with Application in Optimal Control of Semi-linear Parabolic Partial Differential Equations. arXiv:1611.04050\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See, e.g., Tu, Rowley, Luchtenburg, Brunton, Kutz (2013): On Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Theory and Applications arXiv:1312.0041\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1583591178,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583591178,"objectID":"44f0fa67fba26f8cf1c723ed5710c914","permalink":"/post/fenics-burger-pod-dmd/","publishdate":"2020-03-07T15:26:18+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/fenics-burger-pod-dmd/","section":"post","summary":"A short python implementation of POD and DMD for a 2D Burgers equation using FEniCS and Scipy.","tags":[],"title":"FEniCS Burgers POD DMD","type":"post"},{"authors":["Peter Benner","Jan Heiland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"486bf67d87e9f27f2e00fc94a6ec5c51","permalink":"/publication/ben-h-20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ben-h-20/","section":"publication","summary":"The Riccati-based approach to robust control is completely understood in theory since long but seldom used for large-scale systems in practice. Only recently, we have transferred iterative algorithms that allow the computation of solutions to LQR Riccati equations in the large-scale setting to the indefinite Riccati equations that appear in robust control. For descriptor systems, the relevant Riccati equations are nonsymmetric and, for large-scale systems, there is no established algorithm that can handle these even in the LQR case. In this paper, we show how the general theory for descriptor systems with index-1 pencil coincides with the theory for standard linear time invariant case with feedthrough terms. This provides an algorithm to characterize and to compute the solution to the generalized indefinite Riccati equations via standard Riccati equations. In view of feasibility for large-scale descriptor systems, we illustrate how to arrive at the equivalent standard Riccati-equation without resorting to the canonical form used in the derivation of the theoretical results.","tags":["BenH20"],"title":"Equivalence of Riccati-based Robust Controller Design for Index-1 Descriptor Systems and Standard Plants with Feedthrough","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jens Bremer","Jan Heiland","Peter Benner","Kai Sundmacher"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606043769,"objectID":"ded6d8e48e641b8a6ed488098f23cfcd","permalink":"/publication/bre-hbs-21/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bre-hbs-21/","section":"publication","summary":"The optimization of a controlled process in a simulation without access to the model itself is a common scenario and very relevant to many chemical engineering applications.

Typically, surrogate models are less complex than the original model equations so that they can be used to simulate the same phenomena but in less computation time (speedup) and with lower memory requirements (compression). The theory of DMD is more than 100 years old. In practice, DMD has experienced strong popularity within the last 10 years, mostly due to interesting and successful application examples in flow problems.\nIn the context of numerical investigation of PDEs in general and flow problems in particular, the snapshots can be considered as approximate solutions at given time instances. Each of these approximate solutions are discrete functions which are defined on a spatial mesh. If the mesh is constant over all time instances, DMD is readily applicable.\nIn this master\u0026rsquo;s thesis, we will pursue the case, in which the mesh changes over time, which is intended in applications. We will develop a formulation for DMD which is independent of the spatial meshes and propose numerical realizations which exceed simple interpolation approaches.\nRequirements For this work, knowledge or particular interests in the following fields are of advantage:\n numerics of partial differential equations and numerical simulation  as well as programming expertise (most suitable in Python or C++).\nContact In case of interest or request for further details, please contact\n Dr. Carmen Gräßle \u0026ndash; [graessle@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de](mailto: graessle@mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de)  or\n Jun.-Prof. Jan Heiland \u0026ndash; [jan.heiland@ovgu.de](mailto: jan.heiland@ovgu.de)  ","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"2fe8e6fa76f74ffea1fd77d84d60e8d0","permalink":"/project/20-ma-dmd/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/20-ma-dmd/","section":"project","summary":"on *DMD models for flow problems based on time series using adaptive grids*","tags":["BA-MA"],"title":"Open Master Thesis","type":"project"},{"authors":["Chayan Bhawal","Jan Heiland","Peter Benner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"dd148c43dd27e60668885851bd31d154","permalink":"/publication/bha-hb-20/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bha-hb-20/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we present a method to compute the optimal trajectories of a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem corresponding to a single input, index-1 constant coefficient DAE system.

The flow around a free rigid body causes both displacement and rotation of that body, via the forces and torque exerted from the fluid onto the body. Conversely, the motion of the body causes changes in the flow. The complexity that comes with coupling models for fluid and elastic or rigid bodies and the numerical challenges due to evolving geometrical domains make reliable and benchmark computations very necessary though difficult to perform. This talk presents a setup that we have designed to particularly investigate the effects regarding the free rotation of a spherical object in a flow channel in 2D and 3D. This setup connects to the well known benchmark of flow past a cylinder [1] and is accessible to standard CFD software.\n Figure 1: Spatial configuration of the 3D setup.\n In this setup the flow applies a torque force on the object. The induced rotation then couples back to the flow via the boundary conditions. We discuss the governing equations of this fluid structure interaction problem; namely the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the relevant realizations of Newton’s second law that relates the rotation of the rigid body to the forces acting on it. The proposed benchmark configurations comprise two and three spatial dimensions and quasi-stationary (low Reynolds-number) and periodic (high Reynolds-number) regimes. For a discretization independent comparison of the results, we also propose significant, nondimensionalized characteristic values.\nThe benchmark cases were solved numerically with various approaches and software tools so that the computed characteristic values could be reported within in a reasonable confidence interval.\nIn this talk, we introduce the mathematical model, discuss the characteristic and challenges of the benchmark cases, and present the various implementation and their particular advantages.

To overcome these numerical difficulties, a large number of time stepping schemes, with Chorin\u0026rsquo;s projection or the SIMPLE scheme as notable examples, have been developed.\nIn this talk, we trace down and illustrate the instability that origins from the index-2 structure and show that commonly and succesfully applied time-stepping schemes correspond to a reformulation of the semi-discrete NSE as an equivalent system of index-1. Also we show how a finite-element discretization by Taylor-Hood or Crouzeix-Raviart schemes can be modified such that the resulting semi-discrete NSE already is of index-1 so that standard time-integration schemes lead to stable pressure approximations.\nReferences\nAltmann, R. \u0026amp; Heiland, J.: Finite Element Decomposition and Minimal Extension for Flow Equations, ESAIM: M2AN, 2015, 49, 1489\u0026ndash;1509\nAltmann, R. \u0026amp; Heiland, J.: Continuous, Semi-discrete, and Fully Discretized Navier-Stokes Equations, DAE-Forum, Issue: Applications of Differential-Algebraic Equations: Examples and Benchmarks, Springer, 2018\n","date":1570025400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570025400,"objectID":"0aeabec9129026d3749b276b8bb9268b","permalink":"/event/19-enumath-nse/","publishdate":"2019-05-26T14:19:01+02:00","relpermalink":"/event/19-enumath-nse/","section":"event","summary":"By analysing the Kronecker index of the difference-algebraic equations, that represent commonly and successfully used time stepping schemes for the Navier-Stokes equations, we show that those time-integration schemes factually remove strangeness.

It has been applied in various types of flows including internal combustion engines, film cooling flows, and in natural convection. When using micron-size particles, the particles follow the flow, and their temperature is at equilibrium with the gas. If we illuminate the particles with a UV laser, the particles absorb the UV light, and then, they re-emit visible light called luminescence. The colour of the emitted light depends on the temperature of the particles, so by recording the light on a camera, we can determine the temperature of the particle, and therefore that of the gas.\nTypically, we collect light from the particles with a lens as shown in Fig. 1 a). Only particles that are within the thin laser sheet (shown in purple) are excited, and emit frequency shifted light (here shown by the red rays). A filter is placed in front of the camera to only collect the frequency-shifted luminescence. However, when there are many particles, light emitted by particle can bounce off other particles, and the spatial information may be lost. Pathways for wanted and unwanted luminescence being collected on the detectors are shown on Figures 1. The wanted scenario mentioned above is a). In unwanted scenarios b-d), either excitation light or luminescence emission is scattered by particles outside the probe volume. The objective of this project is to theoretically quantify the contribution of unwanted light by implementing Mie scattering theory2 with random particle positions. More detail on Mie scattering theory can be found the following link:\nTask description: a) Improve the current model by developing numerical schemes to increase the spatial resolution to computational cost ratio.\nb) Quantify the contribution of multiple scattering relative (b and c) for a reference experimental configuration.\nc) Validate the model against the result of measurements performed in the reference experimental configuration in Fond´s group.\nd) Determine the scaling factor (size of coflow, seeding density ratio, imaginary over real part of index of refraction), and compare with experimental observations.\ne) Estimate the relative probability of three particle events compared to the two particle event of scenarios b and c).\n  C.

This, in a sense, means that suitable controls are known and that the optimization looks for those with the least magnitude. For people like me, that use optimization because they don\u0026rsquo;t know a control, this seems not very feasible. But Pontryagin has the answer for that too:\nMaximum Principle with Variable Endpoints One can (partially) abandon the end conditions, see Chapter I.7 in Pontryagin\u0026rsquo;s book. Similarly, one can abandon the initial conditions which, again, seems odd from an application point of view. Also, simply omitting the end conditions will lead to trivial solutions. Certainly, we need to include them in the optimization. Which leads to the Wikipedia case.\nThe Wikipedia Case Commonly used and illustrated on wikipedia:Pontryagin\u0026rsquo;s maximum principle \u0026ndash; the form that leaves the controls free but penalizes the endpoint. Now, let me show how this form derives from Pontryagin\u0026rsquo;s book.\nConnecting Wikipedia and Pontryagin The derivation of the Wikipedia formulas from the Maximum Principle with Variable Endpoints goes as follows:\n  Transform (see, e.g., Enc. of Math.: Bolza problem) the problem from Mayer form to Lagrange form.\n  Put the resulting system into the form of Pontryagin.\n  Apply the maximum principle with completely free endpoints.\n  For the pendulum optimal control problem\n$$\\frac{1}{2}(\\theta(t_1)^2 + p(t_1)^2) +\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} g_1^2 + g_2^2 ;dt \\to \\min$$\nsubject to\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot \\theta \u0026amp;= \\frac{p}{mL^2},\\\\\\\\ \\dot p \u0026amp;= -mg_1L\\cos \\theta - mg_2L\\sin \\theta. \\end{aligned} $$\nwith initial conditions\n$$ \\theta(t_0)=\\pi, \\quad p(t_0)=0 $$\nthis means:\nI. Lagrange form We get rid of the costs that are put on the terminal values by introducing a variable $\\tilde x$. Thus the optimal control problem no reads:\n$$ \\mathcal J:=\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\tilde x + \\frac{1}{2}(g_1^2+g_2^2) ;dt \\to \\min $$\nsubject to\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot {\\tilde x} \u0026amp;= 0, \\\\\\\\ \\dot \\theta \u0026amp;= \\frac{p}{mL^2},\\\\\\\\ \\dot p \u0026amp;= -mg_1L\\cos \\theta - mg_2L\\sin \\theta. \\end{aligned} $$\nwith one end condition\n$$ \\tilde x(t_1) = \\frac{1}{2(t_1-t_0)}(\\theta(t_1)^2+p(t_1)^2), $$\nand the old initial conditions\n$$ \\theta(t_0)=\\pi, \\quad p(t_0)=0. $$\n In fact, since $\\tilde x$ is constant and fixed by its end condition, one obtains that\n  $\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\tilde x ;dt = (t_1 - t_0)\\tilde x(t_1) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\theta(t_1)^2+p(t_1)^2).$\n Once in Lagrange form, the problem can be put into the form used in Pontryagin\u0026rsquo;s theorem:\nII. Pontryagin\u0026rsquo;s terms $$ x^0(t_1) \\to \\min $$\nsubject to\n$$ \\begin{aligned} \\dot x^0 \u0026amp;= \\tilde x + \\frac{1}{2}(g_1^2+g_2^2), \\\\\\\\ \\dot {\\tilde x} \u0026amp;= 0, \\\\\\\\ \\dot \\theta \u0026amp;= \\frac{p}{mL^2},\\\\\\\\ \\dot p \u0026amp;= -mg_1L\\cos \\theta - mg_2L\\sin \\theta. \\end{aligned} $$\nwith initial conditions\n\\begin{equation} x^0(t_0)=0, \\quad \\theta(t_0)=\\pi, \\quad p(t_0)=0, \\end{equation}\nand the end condition\n$$ \\tilde x(t_1) = \\frac{1}{2(t_1-t_0)}(\\theta(t_1)^2+p(t_1)^2). $$\n Here, the trick is that the new variable $x^0$ simply integrates the value of the cost functional.\n The corresponding adjoint system for the $\\psi$ reads4\n\\begin{align} \\dot \\psi_0 \u0026amp;= 0, \\\\\\\\ \\dot \\psi_1 \u0026amp;= -\\psi_0, \\\\\\\\ \\dot \\psi_2 \u0026amp;= -(mg_1L\\sin\\theta - mg_2L\\cos\\theta) \\psi_3, \\\\\\\\ \\dot \\psi_3 \u0026amp;= -\\frac{1}{mL^2}\\psi_2. \\end{align}\nThis $\\psi$ defines the control Hamiltonian as\n$$ \\bigl(\\psi, f(x;G) \\bigl ) = \\bigl(\\psi, \\begin{bmatrix} \\tilde x + \\frac{1}{2}(g_1^2+g_2^2) \\\\\\\\ 0 \\\\\\\\ \\frac{p}{mL^2}\\\\\\\\ -mg_1L\\cos \\theta - mg_2L\\sin \\theta \\end{bmatrix} \\bigl ) $$\nIII. Pontryagin with variable endpoints Finally, we can omit parts of the end conditions.\nIf we let the state $(\\tilde x, \\theta, p)$ at $t_1$ take on an arbitrary value then it will belong to the hypersurface\n$$ S_1 = {(\\frac{1}{2(t_1-t_0)}(\\theta^2 + p^2), \\theta, p)} \\subset \\mathbb R^3 $$\nThen the transversality condition5 that $\\psi(t_1)$ has to be orthogonal to the tangent plane to $S_1$ at $(\\tilde x(t_1), \\theta(t_1), p(t_1))$ gives the following boundary conditions for $\\psi$:\n\\begin{align} \\frac{1}{t_1-t_0}p(t_1)\\psi_1(t_1) - \\psi_3(t_1) \u0026amp;= 0, \\\\\\\\ \\frac{1}{t_1-t_0}\\theta(t_1)\\psi_1(t_1) - \\psi_2(t_1) \u0026amp;= 0. \\end{align}\n These give the Wikipedia terminal condition for the adjoint state with the choice of $\\psi_1(t_1) = t_1-t_0$.\n Note that these particular end conditions were derived from the particular basis\n$$ \\biggl\\{ \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{t_1-t_0}p \\\\ 0 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{t_1-t_0}\\theta \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\biggr\\} $$\nof the tangent space and note that any other basis can be taken, or equivalently, any linear combination of the boundary conditions are feasible.\nReferences 📙 Pontryagin, Boltyanski, Gamkrelidze, and Mishchenko (1962) The Mathematical Theory of Optimal Processes\n  Lemma 6.5 in Heiland (2013) Decoupling, Semi-Discretization, and Optimal Control of Semi-linear Semi-explicit Index-2 Abstract Differential-Algebraic Equations and Application in Optimal Flow Control\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n cp. the text before Theorem 3.4 in Ober-Blöbaum, Junge, Marsden (2008) Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control: an Analysis]\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Ch.

Based on these findings, we argue that known concepts from robust control can be exploited to come up with an output feedback law that can stabilize the cylinder wake over the transition period from a stable to a stabilized regime.","tags":["robust stabilization","flow control","coprime factorization","perturbation theory","nonlinear control systems","linearization"],"title":"Robust Stabilization of Laminar Flows in Varying Flow Regimes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Altmann","Jan Heiland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"77f44fe1ca453f53b98e957394fa8a9f","permalink":"/publication/alt-h-15/","publishdate":"2015-09-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/alt-h-15/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract.In the simulation of flows, the correct treatment of the pressure variable is the key to stabletime-integration schemes. This paper contributes a new approach based on the theory of differential-algebraic equations. Motivated by the index reduction technique of minimal extension, a remodellingof the flow equations is proposed. It is shown how this reformulation can be realized for standard finiteelementsviaa decomposition of the discrete spaces and that it ensures stable and accurate approxi-mations. The presented decomposition preserves sparsity and does not call on variable transformationswhich might change the meaning of the variables. Since the method is eventually an index reduction,high index effects leading to instabilities are eliminated.","tags":null,"title":"Finite Element Decomposition and Minimal Extension for Flow Equations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Baumann","Jan Heiland","Michael Schmidt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"06877067d450468a4399963e6489d10c","permalink":"/publication/bau-hs-15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bau-hs-15/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Discrete Input/Output Maps and their Relation to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Benner","Jan Heiland"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"6fe409fc3ec1390f4c370c7077427798","permalink":"/publication/ben-h-15/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ben-h-15/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent theoretical and simulation results have shown that Riccati based feedback can stabilize flows at moderate Reynolds numbers.
